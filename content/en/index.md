# GriefDefender Wiki
*For Bukkit/Sponge servers.*

A universal solution for protecting your servers against grief.  
It works out of the box and fully integrates with [LuckPerms](https://ci.lucko.me/job/LuckPerms/).

> **Note: Since GriefDefender relies heavily on permission contexts, it has a hard dependency on [LuckPerms]. See <https://github.com/lucko/LuckPerms/wiki/Migration> on how to migrate to LP from another permissions plugin.

## Features

* **NEW!** Spawn-limits to avoid having farms with huge amount of entities in the same place/chunk (configurabe per claim, all claims, wilderness and much more) - Boost your server performance with this feature!
